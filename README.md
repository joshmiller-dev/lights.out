# lights.out
Lights Out game I made in to practice jquery.  Only jquery was used.  I also made this game before seeing the course in React on Udemy for Light's Out as you can see from my outdated vanilla javascript.  Includes logic to ensure all patterns are solvable.  Also includes a way to show a solution (although not in the least amount of moves).
